# Methods of Tuples.

Tuple = (50, 100, 45, 10, "Rahman", "Farhan", "Zia", 500, 100)

# Common Tuple Methods.

Count = Tuple.count(100)         # This function counts the data type that the data types are repeated how many times.

print(Count)

Slicing = Tuple.index("Zia")     # This Function is used for slicing the Tuple.

print(Slicing)

# Other Tuple Tricks.

Length = len(Tuple)              # This Function is used to see the length of the tuple it tells you that the tuple have 6 words length or 7 words length

print(Length)

In = "Zia" in Tuple              # This Function is used to see that if the data type or word or integer is in the tuple or not .This Function gives you 

                                 # the output in boolean data type

print(In)

list = [1 ,1 , 2]

converted = tuple(list)           # This Function is ussed to convert the List into Tuple. 

print(converted)
